# MDPI_Algorithms_2021-iCC-SHADE
This program code implements the iCC-SHADE algorithm for solving large-scale global optimization problems. iCC changes the number of variables in subcomponents dynamically during the optimization process. The SHADE algorithm is used as a subcomponent optimizer. The problems are presented as the benchmark set (LSGO CEC'2013).
We use the MPICH2 framework to implement parallel numerical experiments on our computing cluster.
